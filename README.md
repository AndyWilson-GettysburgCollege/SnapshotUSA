R code to analyze SnapshotUSA camera trapping data
I use tidyverse and suncalc packages in R to create visualizations of data from citizen science camera trapping project SnapshotUSA
SnapshotUSA website: https://emammal.si.edu/snapshot-usa

Fonts & line sizes etc. are set so that a 1500 x 1500 pixel png export in R Studio looks like the four examples included.
I'd be happy for suggestions for updating and streamlining the code (I'm not very proficient): awilson@gettysburg.edu
